"Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. 'The Advancing Giant') is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes.    

After 10 years and going through two different anime studios, Attack on Titan’s anime has finally come to a close. The series finale, for better or worse, was largely the same as the extended ending to the manga with a few small changes, so people who read the manga and people who only watched the anime will likely have similar reactions to its conclusion.

Having unlocked the full power of the Founding Titan, Eren started the Rumbling and sent his Titans around the world to kill everyone outside of Paradis Island. Despite knowing that the Rumbling is the only way to ensure the safety of their home and that they don’t have any better ideas, Armin, Mikasa, Levi, and the rest of Eren’s former allies refuse to accept genocide as a solution, and they team up with some of the Marleyan forces to stop Eren.
